# Hungry Hungry Caterpillar

Hello! Thanks for checking out my trash little snake game.
I have been learning to write and figured this should be my first "big" project.

I went a bit overboard and added a bunch of little things which I found enjoyable and a challenge to figure out and learn.

its a normal snake game! if you get to 200 points you will hatch a butterfly and it will fly around randomly for the remander of you game.
